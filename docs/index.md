# The Future

In March 2010, I released Sins Data Converter to the public for the first time. I was an avid fan of Sins of a Solar Empire, and I enjoyed playing with various mods for the game. I simply used my programming skills (which were rather pathetic at the time) to create a tool to help make these activities a little easier for me, and I decided to share it with the community just for the heck of it.

The release was very successful, and the tool developed more of a following than I expected. I continued to maintain the project for some time, as Ironclad Games continued to release breaking changes and expansions. By September 2012, the feature set of the tool had expanded substantially. In March 2013, I announced a full code rewrite of Sins Data Converter to bring it up to speed with my greatly expanded knowledge of object-oriented programming.

**That update was never released.**

By the middle of 2013, I had lost most of my interest in Sins of a Solar Empire. I was busy in college, and the modding community for the game seemed to have hit a lull. When I realized that I was no longer getting feedback or downloads for Sins Data Converter, I decided the world had moved on, and I never finished the code rewrite.

Nothing changed for three years. But in the summer of 2016, I got a couple of emails from people who had obviously found the contact form on the old project website. A little later on, I went on the Sins of a Solar Empire forums for the first time in years, and discovered that a few people had expressed interest in my utility now and then. And something I had written on the forums back in 2010 caught my eye:

*“This program is NOT being released and then dropped.”*

And yet, I left the software in a state where the only version that worked with Rebellion—the only version of the game readily available to new players today—was a beta that didn’t even have an official download link anymore. While the software still works fine when I load it up, some others have complained about problems with the last version. I decided that it wasn’t fair for the software to just disappear the way it did, but I’m also not in a position to resume working on it daily the way I did as a teenager, or test it in all the different configurations that are out there now. So I’ve decided to do what, back then, I always told myself I’d do if I ever got tired of developing a piece of software that people actually used.

## Sins Data Converter is back, and it’s going open source.

From now on, the full source code for Sins Data Converter will be right here on GitHub for anybody who wants to play with it. I’m not gonna lie, I was 17 when I first developed this tool, and the code is **an absolute embarrassment**. It’s disorganized, not at all object-oriented, and has tons of inefficient redundancies and poorly engineered solutions. It’s not the abandoned code rewrite, since I have no idea how far I got with that. It’s the v2.1 Beta that came out in September 2012, written in Visual Basic and XAML. But it is under the Mozilla Public License now, warts and all; so, if you want to want to make any improvements or changes, whether to share with everyone or just for your personal needs, have at it.

And I won’t necessarily vanish back into the void, either. I’ll be keeping an eye on things, looking at pull requests and issues, and contributing here and there when I have time and/or interest. If this takes off, who knows, I might someday give that full code rewrite a second try from scratch and show you all how much better I’ve gotten at programming in the last seven years.

But in the meantime, if you want to contribute, or just get the last official release of the Rebellion-compatible tool for your modding adventures, head on up to the “View on GitHub” link above. If you have any problems, create a new Issue with as many details as possible so that I or someone else can evaluate it. (And if you are just coming to download the executable, make sure you check the Issues list to know what you’re getting into.)

Thanks to those who have continued to show interest in this project during the long hiatus! I hope that this new approach will provide a way for Sins Data Converter to continue to benefit however much of the community is still around to use it.
