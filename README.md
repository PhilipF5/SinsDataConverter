# Sins Data Converter
Sins Data Converter is a modding tool for the classic PC strategy game Sins of Solar Empire. It provides an easy-to-use, comprehensive GUI for the ConvertData command line utility provided by game developer Ironclad Games. Use of ConvertData is required to translate game files from the machine-readable binary format into an human-readable raw text format for modding. Sins Data Converter boasts a full set of impressive features that take advantage of ConvertData's flexibility to offer modders a large selection of options, none of which require any knowledge of or proficiency with the command line.

This utility was abandoned in 2013 amid an ambitious code rewrite project that seemed to attract very little interest from the community. It's now being resurrected as an open-source project so that it has a better chance at usefulness, improvement, and continued maintenance moving forward. The initial GitHub version of the project throws out the abandoned rewrite and returns to the last released version, the v2.1 Beta that added basic support for the Rebellion expansion. That means, among other things, that the code is absolutely awful. But it seems to still work despite changes to SoaSE and Windows itself over the years.
